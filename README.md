# Bar Pal
Simple solution when having a fridge at work or in a community where members and employees
can get stuff from the fridge and pay for it via local credits in the system.

There is the possibility to have a stock of products in different locations and also to have credits for each user.
The credits can be added by a user with the role of cashier.

Barpal is built on Springboot and requires mysql to run in the first run, with possibly more lightweight solution in the future.
